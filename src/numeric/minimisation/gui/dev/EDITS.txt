To do:

    To allow graph to update when performing many rapid-fire steps, need to
    perform call to GNUplot from the event dispatch thread (or something like that...).
    Must allow one GNUplot process to complete before the next is started.

    Implement 'all steps' button and convergence criteria for solvers.

    Further configure graphs using hints from cost functions (e.g. contour intervals etc)

    Implement more solvers.
